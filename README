This is 'clapl'. (CommandLine AudioPlayer with Lyricsupport)

It is using ncurses to draw into the terminal.
The playback uses the ffmpeg api aswell as libao.
The music library is stored in a sqlite3 database in the config folder.
The program is combined with a simple parser for configuration files, so you can change some settings.

Because I still struggle creating PKGBUIL files there is none yet. I hope some time in the future I will be able to provide this aswell.
