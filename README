'TABULAR' is switching between artist and album selection

':' opens a simple command line

press 'q' to quit

you may find the config file in at '.config/clapl/'



#### some technical information #####

It is using ncurses to draw into the terminal.
The playback uses the ffmpeg api aswell as libao.
The music library is stored in a sqlite3 database in the config folder.
The program is combined with a simple parser for configuration files, so you can change some settings.

Because I still struggle creating PKGBUIL files there is none yet. I hope some time in the future I will be able to provide this aswell.
